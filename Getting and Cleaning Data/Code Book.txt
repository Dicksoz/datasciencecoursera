These data were prepared as an excersice for the Course listed above from data calculated in the study listed below
These data were arranged from several files containing meta- and raw data into a single data set using the script in "run_analysis.R"
Only a subset of the data was taken; those which were mean and standard deviation calculations
The resulting dataset was then processed to calculate the mean over replicate runs with specific subjects and activities.
The final dataset is contained in the file "MeanData.txt" which is tab delimited with a header line, and a new record on every subsequent line.

Column names are as follows:

SubjectID - A number identifying to which subject the mean values correspond; an integer between 1 and 30
Activity - A character vector describing what the subject was doing when the measurments were taken.

The remaining columns are named by the specific measurment to which they correspond. More information can be found in the included "Meas.txt" and "Meas_info.txt"
